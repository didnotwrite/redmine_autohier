h1. What this plugin does

It automatically sets a wiki page's parent page based on its name.

For example:
* "*HowTo>ManageYourTeam*" will set its parent page to "!HowTo".
* "*HowTo>ManageYourTeam>TheHardWay" will set its parent page to "HowTo>ManageYourTeam".

Benefits:
* You don't have to select a parent page from a long drop-down list.
* A page's path of parent pages shows up in the URL.
* Very easy to create a child page for the wiki page you're on. Just add ">NewChild" to your current URL.
* You now know to go straight to "Rename" to change its parent page -- which is not very intuitive.


h1. Installation

script/plugin install git://github.com/merikonjatta/redmine_autohier.git

Or, you could download the zip file and extract its contents to *redmine_dir/vendor/plugins*.

Restart your redmine app.


h1. Usage

Use '>' in your page title to set its path.


h2. Moving whole trees

Once you rename a wiki page that have child pages, all of them will be renamed accordingly.

Example: Say you have a page named "*!PlannedTrips>Japan*" which has a whole lot of child pages like 
 * "!PlannedTrips>Japan>Hotels"
 * "!PlannedTrips>Japan>Transportation"
and so on.

Renaming "*!PlannedTrips>Japan*" to "*!PastTrips>Japan*" will rename all of its child pages accordingly, resulting in
 * "!PastTrips>Japan"
 * "!PastTrips>Japan>Hotels"
 * "!PastTrips>Japan>Transportation"


h2. Redirections

Redmine has an option to set redirections when you change a wiki page's name.
This options is applied to all child pages when you move a whole tree.
