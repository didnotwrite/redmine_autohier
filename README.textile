h1. What this plugin does

It automatically sets a wiki page's parent page based on its name.

For example:
* "*HowTo>ManageYourTeam*" will be a child page of  "*HowTo*".
* "*HowTo>ManageYourTeam>TheHardWay*" will be a child page of "HowTo>ManageYourTeam".

Benefits:
* You don't have to select a parent page from a long drop-down list.
* A page's path of parent pages shows up in the URL.
* Very easy to create a child page for the wiki page you're on. Just add ">NewChild" to your current URL.
* You now know to go straight to "Rename" to change its parent page -- which is not very intuitive.


h1. Installation

@script/plugin install git://github.com/merikonjatta/redmine_autohier.git@

Or, you could download the zip file and extract its contents to *redmine_dir/vendor/plugins*.

h1. Usage

Use '>' in your page title to set its path.


h2. Moving whole trees

Once you rename a wiki page that have child pages, all of them will be renamed accordingly.

Example: Say you have
 * "PlannedTrips>Japan"
 * "PlannedTrips>Japan>Hotels"
 * "PlannedTrips>Japan>Transportation"
and so on. Rename "*PlannedTrips>Japan*" to "*PastTrips>Japan*" and you get
 * "PastTrips>Japan"
 * "PastTrips>Japan>Hotels"
 * "PastTrips>Japan>Transportation"


h2. Redirections

Redmine has an option to set redirections when you change a wiki page's name. This options is applied to all child pages when you move a whole tree.
